## Project Description

This is my capstone project for Power BI for a fictitious consulting firm - Abbey Consoluting. The organization provides IT and BPO Services in three US locations, namely Charlotte, Nashville and Cleveland. The organization would like to closely track and report on utilization in order to ensure that minimum billing targets are achieved on a per employee basis. In order to achieve this, the data model must contain Hours and Budgets as Facts and Date, Branch, Division, Employee and Project as Dimensions.

Thus the Utilization report contains the following pages:
- Executive Summary
- Division Management
- Branch Management
- Hours Details
- Employee Details  

The report is also available on the web. The link to the report is as follows:
